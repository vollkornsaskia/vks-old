<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span>   ma­na­­ger of the new Im­­pe­ri­al Re­­stau­rant on the Tha­­mes Em­­bank­­ment went
in­to his lu­­xu­rious pri­va­te of­­fi­ce and shut the door. Ha­ving do­­ne so, he
­­first scrat­ched his chin re­flec­ti­ve­­ly, and then took a let­ter from the
dra­wer in which it had re­­po­­sed for mo­­re than two months and pe­ru­­sed it
­­care­­ful­­ly. Though he was not awa­­re of it, this was the thir­tieth time he
had read it sin­­ce break­fast that mor­­ning. And yet he was not a whit
­­ne­a­­rer un­­­der­­stan­­ding it than he had be­en at the be­­gin­­ning. He tur­­ned it
o­­ver and scru­ti­­ni­­zed the back, whe­­re not a sign of wri­ting was to be
­­se­en; he held it up to the win­­dow, as if he might ho­­pe to dis­­co­­ver­­
­­so­­me­thing from the wa­ter­­-­­­mark; but the­­re was nothing in eit­her of the­­se
­­pla­­ces of a na­ture ca­l­­cu­la­ted to set his trou­b­led mind at rest. Then he
took a ma­g­ni­­fi­­cent re­­pea­ter watch from his waist­­coat po­cket and glan­­ce­d
at the di­a­l; the hands stood at ha­l­f­­-­­past se­­ven. He im­­me­­di­a­te­­ly thre­w
­­the let­ter on the ta­ble, and as he did so his an­­xie­­ty found re­­li­ef in­­ words.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s re­a­l­­ly the most ex­tra­or­­di­na­ry af­fair I ever had to do with,” he
re­­ma­r­ke­d. “And as I’­­ve be­en in the bu­si­­ness just three­­-­­an­d­­-thir­­ty yea­r­s
at ele­­ven a.m. next Mon­day mor­­ning, I ought to know so­­me­thing about it.
I on­­ly ho­­pe I’­­ve do­­ne right, that’s all.”</p> 
 <p>As he spo­ke, the chief book­kee­per, who had the treble ad­van­ta­ge of bein­g
tall, pret­ty, and just eight­-­an­d­-t­wen­ty years of age, en­te­red the room.
S­he no­ti­ced the open let­ter and the look upon her chie­f’s fa­ce, and her
­cu­ri­o­si­ty was pro­por­ti­o­na­te­ly ex­ci­te­d.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You seem wor­rie­d, Mr. Mc­­Pher­­son,” she said ten­­der­­ly, as she put dow­n
­­the pa­­pers she had brought in for his ­­si­­gna­ture.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You ha­­ve just hit it, Miss O’­­Sul­­li­van,” he an­s­we­re­d, pu­s­hing them
f­a­r­ther on to the ta­­ble. “I am wor­ried about ma­ny things, but
pa­r­ti­­cu­la­r­­ly about this let­ter.”</p> 
 <p>He han­ded the epist­le to her, and she, being de­si­rous of im­pres­sing him
with her busi­ness ca­pa­bi­li­ties, read it with os­ten­ta­tious care. But it
­was no­ti­cea­ble that when she re­a­ched the si­gna­ture she too tur­ned back
to the be­gin­ning, and then de­li­be­ra­te­ly read it over again. The ma­na­ger
ro­se, cros­sed to the man­tel­pie­ce, and rang for the head wai­ter. Ha­ving
re­li­e­ved his fee­lings in this way, he sea­ted him­self again at his
wri­ting­-­ta­ble, put on his glas­ses, and sta­red at his com­pa­n­io­n, whi­le
wai­ting for her to s­peak.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s ve­ry fun­ny,” she sai­d. “Ve­ry fun­ny in­­de­e­d!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It’s the most ex­tra­or­­di­na­ry com­mu­­ni­­ca­ti­on I ha­­ve ever re­­cei­­ve­d,” he
re­p­­lied with con­vic­ti­o­n. “Y­ou see it is writ­ten from Cu­ya­­ba, Bra­­zil. The
­da­te is three months ago to a day. Now I ha­­ve ta­ken the trou­­ble to fin­d
out whe­­re and what Cu­ya­­ba is.”</p> 
 <p>He ma­de this con­fes­si­on with an air of con­s­cious pri­de, and ha­ving do­ne
­so, laid him­self back in his chair, stuck his thumbs in­to the arm­ho­les
of his waist­coat, and loo­ked at his fair sub­or­di­na­te for ap­pro­va­l. Nor
­was he des­ti­ned to be di­s­ap­poin­te­d. He was a ba­che­lor in pos­ses­si­on of a
s­nug in­co­me, and she, be­si­des being pret­ty, was a la­dy with a keen eye
to the main chan­ce.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­­re   <em>is</em>  Cu­ya­ba?” she as­ke­d hum­b­ly.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Cu­ya­­ba,” he re­p­­lie­d, rol­­ling his tongue with con­­si­­de­ra­­ble re­­lish roun­d
his un­­­con­s­­cious mispro­­nun­­cia­ti­on of the na­­me, “is a town al­­most on the
wes­tern or Bo­­li­vi­an bor­­der of Bra­­zil. It is of mo­­de­ra­te si­­ze, is
­­si­tua­ted on the banks of the ri­­ver Cu­ya­­ba, and is con­­si­­dera­b­­ly connec­te­d
with the fa­­mous Bra­­zi­­li­an Dia­­mon­d ­­Fields.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And does the wri­ter of this let­ter li­­ve the­re?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I can­not say. He wri­tes from the­re—that is enough for us.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And he or­­ders din­­ner for four—he­re, in a pri­va­te room over­­loo­king the
ri­­ve­r, three months ahea­d—­­pun­c­tu­a­l­­ly at eight o’clock, gi­­ves you a list
of the things he want­s, and even ar­ran­­ges the de­­cora­ti­on of the ta­­ble.
Says he has ne­­ver seen eit­her of his three fri­ends be­­fo­re; that one of
them hails from (he­­re she con­­sul­ted the let­ter again) Hang­­-­­chow, an­o­ther
from Bloem­­fon­tein, whi­le the third re­­si­­des, at pre­­sent, in Eng­lan­d. Each
o­­ne is to pre­­sent an or­­di­na­ry vi­­si­t­ing card with a red dot on it to the
­­por­ter in the hall, and to be shown to the room at on­­ce. I don’t
un­­der­­stand it at all.”</p> 
 <p>The ma­na­ger pau­sed for a mo­ment, and then said de­li­be­ra­te­ly,—”Hang­-­chow
is in China, Bloem­fon­tein is in South ­Af­ri­ca.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>What a won­­der­­ful man you are, to be su­re, Mr. Mc­­Pher­­son! I ne­­ver can
  <em>think</em>  how you ma­na­ge to car­ry so much in your hea­d.”</p> 
 <p>The­re spo­ke the true wo­man. And it was a mo­ve in the right di­rec­ti­o­n,
­for the ma­na­ger was suscep­ti­ble to her gent­le in­flu­ence, as she ha­d
oc­ca­si­on to know.</p> 
 <p>At this junc­ture the head wai­ter ap­pea­red upon the sce­ne, and took up a
­po­si­ti­on just in­side the door­way, as if he we­re afraid of in­ju­ring the
­ca­r­pet by co­ming f­ar­ther.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is No. 22 rea­dy, Wil­­li­ams?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Qui­te rea­dy, sir. The wi­­ne is on the ice, and cook tells me he’ll be
rea­dy to dish pun­c­tu­al to the ­­mo­­ment.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The let­ter says, ‘no elec­tric light; can­d­les with red sha­­des.’ Ha­­ve you
­­put on tho­­se sha­­des I got this ­­mor­­ning?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Just seen it do­­ne this ve­ry mi­­nu­te, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And let me see, the­­re was one other thing.” He took the let­ter from the
chief boo­k­kee­­per’s hand and glan­­ced at it. “Ah, yes, a por­­ce­lain sau­­cer,
and a small jug of new milk upon the man­tel­pie­­ce. An ex­tra­or­­di­na­ry
re­quest, but has it be­en at­ten­­de­d to?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I put it the­­re my­­sel­f, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Who wait?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Jo­­nes, Ed­­munds, Brooks, an­d Tom­kins.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ve­ry goo­d. Then I think that will do. Stay! You had bet­ter tell the
hall por­ter to look out for three gent­le­­men pre­­sen­ting plain vi­­si­t­ing
­­cards with a lit­t­le red spot on them. Let Brooks wait in the hall, an­d
when they ar­rive tell him to show them straight up to the room.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>It shall be do­­ne, ­­sir.”</p> 
 <p>The head wai­ter left the room, and the ma­na­ger stret­ched him­self in his
chair, yaw­ned by way of sho­wing his im­port­an­ce, and then sai­d ­so­lem­nly,—</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I don’t be­­lie­­ve they’ll any of them turn up; but if they do, this Dr.
­­Ni­­ko­la, whoe­­ver he may be, won’t be ab­le to find fault with my a­r­ran­­ge­­ment­s.”</p> 
 <p>Then, lea­ving the dus­ty high road of Busi­ness, he and his com­pa­n­io­n
wan­de­red in the sha­dy brid­le­-­paths of Love—to the end that when the
chief book­kee­per re­tur­ned to her own de­part­ment she had for­got­ten the
stran­ge din­ner par­ty about to take place ups­tair­s, and was bu­si­ly
en­ga­ged upon a cal­cu­la­ti­on as to how she would look in white sa­tin an­d
oran­ge blos­soms, an­d, that sett­le­d, fell to won­de­ring whe­ther it was
true, as Miss Joy­ce, a sub­or­di­na­te, had be­en heard to de­cla­re, that the
­ma­na­ger had on­ce shown him­self par­ti­al to a cer­tain wi­dow with re­pu­te­d
sa­vings and a share in an ex­ten­si­ve egg and dai­ry ­busi­ness.</p> 
 <p>At ten mi­nu­tes to eight pre­ci­se­ly a han­som drew up at the steps of the
ho­tel. As soon as it stop­pe­d, an un­der­si­zed gent­le­man, with a clean
s­ha­ven coun­te­nance, a ca­no­ni­cal cor­po­ra­ti­o­n, and bow legs, dres­sed in a
­de­ci­ded­ly cle­ri­cal ga­r­b, aligh­te­d. He paid and dischar­ged his cab­man,
and then took from his ti­cket po­cket an or­di­na­ry white vi­si­t­ing card,
which he pre­sen­ted to the gold­-­la­ced in­di­vi­du­al who had ope­ned the
a­pron. The lat­ter, ha­ving no­ted the red spot, cal­led a wai­ter, and the
re­ve­rend gent­le­man was im­me­di­a­te­ly es­cor­te­d ups­tair­s.</p> 
 <p>Hard­ly had the at­ten­dant time to re­turn to his sta­ti­on in the hall,
­be­fo­re a se­cond cab ma­de its ap­pea­ran­ce, clo­se­ly fol­lo­wed by a third.
Out of the se­cond jum­ped a tall, ac­ti­ve, well­-­built man of about thir­ty­
years of age. He was dres­sed in eve­ning dress of the la­test fa­shion, an­d
to con­ce­al it from the vul­gar ga­ze, wore a lar­ge In­ver­ness cape of hea­vy
tex­ture. He al­so in his turn han­ded a white card to the por­ter, an­d,
ha­ving do­ne so, pro­cee­ded in­to the hall, fol­lo­wed by the oc­cu­pant of the
last cab, who had clo­se­ly co­pied his ex­am­ple. This in­di­vi­du­al was al­so
in eve­ning dress, but it was of a dif­fe­rent stamp. It was old­-­fa­shio­ne­d
and had seen much use. The wea­re­r, too, was tal­ler than the or­di­na­ry run
of men, whi­le it was no­ti­cea­ble that his hair was snow­-­whi­te, and that
his face was de­e­p­ly pit­ted with small­pox. Af­ter dis­po­sing of their hats
and coats in an an­te­-­room, they re­a­ched room No. 22, whe­re they foun­d
­the gent­le­man in cle­ri­cal co­stu­me pa­cing im­pa­ti­ent­ly up an­d ­dow­n.</p> 
 <p>Left alo­ne, the tal­lest of the trio, who for want of a bet­ter tit­le we
­may call the Best Dres­sed Man, took out his wat­ch, and ha­ving glan­ced at
it, loo­ked at his com­pa­n­ions. “Gent­le­men,” he sai­d, with a slight
A­me­ri­can ac­cent, “it is three mi­nu­tes to eight o’clock. My na­me is Eas­to­ver­!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I’m glad to he­ar it, for I’m most un­­­com­­mon­­ly hun­­gry,” said the nex­t
ta­l­lest, whom I ha­­ve al­rea­dy de­s­­cri­­bed as being so ma­r­ked by di­­sea­­se.
“­­My na­­me is Pren­d­er­­gast!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>We on­­ly wait for our fri­end and host,” re­­ma­r­ked the cle­ri­­cal gent­le­­man,
as if he felt he ought to take a share in the con­­ver­­sa­ti­o­n, and then, as
an af­ter­t­hought, he con­ti­­nue­d, “My na­­me is ­­Ba­x­ter!”</p> 
 <p>They shook hands all round with mar­ked cor­di­a­li­ty, sea­ted them­sel­ve­s
a­gain, and took it in turns to ex­ami­ne the clock.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­­ve you ever had the ple­a­­su­­re of mee­ting our host be­­fo­re?” as­ked Mr.
­­Ba­x­ter of Mr. Pren­d­er­­gast.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ne­­ver­­,” re­p­­lied that gent­le­­man, with a shake of his hea­d. “Per­haps Mr.
Eas­to­­ver has be­en mo­re ­­for­tu­na­te?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Not I,” was the brief re­­join­­der. “I’­­ve had to do with him off and on
­­for lon­­ger than I care to reckon, but I’­­ve ne­­ver set eyes on him up to ­da­te.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>And whe­­re may he ha­­ve be­en the first time you heard from him?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In Nas­h­vil­le, Ten­­nes­­see,” said Eas­to­­ver. “Af­ter that, Ta­hu­pa­pa, Ne­w
­­Zea­lan­d; af­ter that, Pa­­pee­te, in the So­­ci­e­­ty Is­­lands; then Pe­kin, Chi­­na.
An­d y­ou?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>First ti­­me, Brus­­sels; se­­con­d, Mon­te Vi­­deo; third, Man­da­lay, and then
­­the Gold Coast, Af­ri­­ca. It’s your turn, Mr. ­­Ba­x­ter.”</p> 
 <p>The cl­er­gy­man glan­ced at the ti­me­pie­ce. It was ex­act­ly eight o’clock.
“­First ti­me, Ca­bul, Af­gha­ni­stan; se­con­d, Ni­j­ni Nov­go­ro­d, Rus­sia; third,
Wil­can­nia, Dar­ling Ri­ve­r, Aus­tra­lia; four­th, Val­pa­rai­so, Chi­li; fift­h,
­Na­gasa­ki, Ja­pan.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is evi­­dent­­ly a gre­at tra­­vel­­ler and a most mys­te­rious ­­per­­son.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>He is mo­­re than that,” said Eas­to­­ver with con­vic­ti­o­n; “he is la­te for ­­din­­ner!”</p> 
 <p>Pren­d­er­gast loo­ked at his watch.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That clock is two mi­­nu­tes fast. Hark, the­­re goes Big Ben! Eight exac­t­­ly.”</p> 
 <p>As he spo­ke the door was thrown open and a voi­ce an­noun­ced “Dr. ­Ni­ko­la.”</p> 
 <p>The three men sprang to their feet si­mul­ta­neous­ly, with ex­cla­ma­ti­ons of
as­to­nis­h­ment, as the man they had be­en dis­cus­sing ma­de his ap­pea­ran­ce.</p> 
 <p>It would take mo­re time than I can spa­re the sub­ject to gi­ve you an
a­de­qua­te and in­clu­si­ve de­s­crip­ti­on of the per­son who en­te­red the room at
that mo­ment. In sta­ture he was slight­ly abo­ve the or­di­na­ry, his
s­houl­ders we­re broa­d, his limbs per­fect­ly sha­ped and plain­ly mus­cu­la­r,
­but ve­ry slim. His hea­d, which was ma­gni­fi­cent­ly set upon his shoul­der­s,
­was ad­or­ned with a pro­fu­si­on of glos­sy black hair; his face was
­de­sti­tu­te of be­ard or mou­sta­che, and was of oval sha­pe and hand­so­me
­moul­ding; whi­le his skin was of a dark oli­ve hue, a co­lour which
har­mo­ni­zed well with his pier­cing black eyes and pea­r­ly teeth. His hands
and feet we­re small, and the gre­a­test dan­dy must ha­ve ad­mit­ted that he
­was ir­re­proacha­b­ly dres­se­d, with a neat­ness that bor­de­red on the
­pu­ri­ta­ni­ca­l. In age he might ha­ve be­en any­thing from eight­-­an­d­-t­wen­ty to
­for­ty; in re­a­li­ty he was thir­ty­-­three. He ad­van­ced in­to the room an­d
wal­ked with out­-­stret­ched hand di­rect­ly across to whe­re Eas­to­ver was
­stan­ding by the ­fi­re­place.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Mr. Eas­to­­ver, I feel cer­tain,” he sai­d, fi­­xing his glit­te­ring eyes upon
­­the man he ad­dres­­se­d, and al­lo­wi­ng a cu­rious smi­le to play upon his face.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>That is my na­­me, Dr. Ni­­ko­la,” the other an­s­we­red with evi­­dent sur­pri­­se.
“­­But how on earth can you dis­tin­­guish me from your other ­­guest­s?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ah! it would sur­pri­­se you if you kne­w. And Mr. Pren­d­er­­gast, and Mr.
­­Ba­x­ter. This is de­­light­­ful; I ho­­pe I am not la­te. We had a col­­li­­si­on in­­
­­the Chan­­nel this mor­­ning, and I was al­­most afraid I might not be up to
ti­­me. Din­­ner seems rea­dy; shall we sit down to it?” They sea­te­d
them­­sel­­ve­s, and the me­al com­­mence­d. The Im­­pe­ri­al Re­­stau­rant has ea­r­­ne­d
an en­via­­ble re­­pu­ta­ti­on for doing things well, and the din­­ner that night
­­did not in any way de­tract from its lus­t­­re. But, de­­light­­ful as it all
­­was, it was no­ti­­cea­­ble that the three guests paid mo­­re at­ten­ti­on to
their host than to his ex­­cel­lent   <em>me­nu</em>. As they had said be­fo­re his
ar­ri­va­l, they had all had de­alings with him for se­ver­al year­s, but what
tho­se de­alings we­re they we­re care­ful not to de­s­cri­be. It was mo­re than
­pos­si­ble that they hard­ly li­ked to re­mem­ber them them­sel­ve­s.</p> 
 <p>When cof­fee had be­en ser­ved and the ser­vants had with­draw­n, Dr. Ni­ko­la
ro­se from the ta­ble, and went across to the mas­si­ve si­de­board. On it
­stood a bas­ket of ve­ry cu­rious sha­pe and work­man­ship. This he ope­ne­d,
and as he did so, to the as­to­nis­h­ment of his guest­s, an enor­mous cat, as
black as his mas­ter’s coat, lea­ped out on to the floor. The re­a­son for
­the sau­cer and jug of milk be­ca­me e­vi­dent.</p> 
 <p>Sea­ting him­self at the ta­ble again, the host fol­lo­wed the ex­am­ple of his
­guests and lit a ci­ga­r, blo­wi­ng a cloud of smo­ke lu­xu­rious­ly through his
­de­li­ca­te­ly chi­sel­led no­strils. His eyes wan­de­red round the cor­ni­ce of
­the room, took in the pic­tu­res and de­cora­ti­ons, and then ca­me down to
­meet the faces of his com­pa­n­ions. As they did so, the black cat, ha­ving
­fi­nis­hed its mea­l, sprang on to his shoul­der to crouch the­re, wat­ching
­the three men through the cur­ling smo­ke drift with its green blin­king,
­fi­en­dish eyes. Dr. Ni­ko­la smi­led as he no­ti­ced the ef­fect the ani­mal ha­d
u­pon his ­guest­s.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Now shall we get to bu­si­­ness?” he sai­d ­­bris­k­ly.</p> 
 <p>The others al­most si­mul­ta­neous­ly kno­cked the as­hes off their ci­gars an­d
­brought them­sel­ves to at­ten­ti­o­n. Dr. Ni­ko­la’s dain­ty, lan­guid man­ner
­see­med to drop from him li­ke a cloak, his eyes brigh­te­ne­d, and his
voi­ce, when he spo­ke, was clean cut as chi­sel­le­d ­sil­ver.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You are doub­t­less an­­xious to be in­­­for­­med why I sum­­mo­­ned you from all
parts of the glo­­be to meet me here to­­-­­­night? And it is ve­ry na­tu­ral you
s­hould be. But then, from what you know of me, you should not be
­­sur­pri­­sed at any­thing I ­­do.”</p> 
 <p>His voi­ce drop­ped back in­to its old to­ne of gent­le lan­guor. He drew in a
­gre­at breath of smo­ke and then sent it slow­ly out from his lips again.
His eyes we­re ha­lf clo­se­d, and he drum­med with one fin­ger on the ta­ble
ed­ge. The cat loo­ked through the smo­ke at the three men, and it see­me­d
to them that he grew eve­ry mo­ment lar­ger and mo­re fero­cious. Pre­sent­ly
his ow­ner took him from his per­ch, and sea­ting him on his knee fell to
stro­king his fur, from head to tail, with his long slim fin­ger­s. It was
as if he we­re dra­wing in­spi­ra­ti­on for some dead­ly mi­s­chief from the
un­can­ny ­be­ast.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>To pre­face what I ha­­ve to say to you, let me tell you that this is by­­
far the most im­­por­t­ant bu­si­­ness for which I ha­­ve ever re­­qui­red your
hel­p. (Three slow stro­kes down the cen­tre of the back, and one roun­d
e­ach ea­r.) When it first ca­­me in­­to my mind I was at a loss who to tru­st
in the mat­ter. I thought of Ven­­don, but I found Ven­­don was dea­d. I
thought of Brow­n­low, but Brow­n­low was no lon­­ger faith­­ful. (T­wo stro­kes
­­down the back and two on the thro­a­t.) Then bit by bit I re­­mem­­be­red you.
I was in Bra­­zil at the time. So I sent for you. You ca­­me. So far so ­­goo­d.”</p> 
 <p>He ro­se, and cros­sed over to the fi­re­place. As he went the cat craw­le­d
­back to its ori­gi­nal po­si­ti­on on his shoul­der. Then his voi­ce chan­ge­d
on­ce mo­re to its for­mer busi­ness­-­li­ke to­ne.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I am not going to tell you ve­ry much about it. But from what I do tell
y­ou, you will be ab­le to ga­ther a gre­at deal and ima­­gi­­ne the rest. To
­­be­­gin with, the­­re is a man li­ving in this world to­­-­­day who has do­­ne me a
­­gre­at and las­ting in­­ju­ry. What that in­­ju­ry is is no con­­cern of your­s.
Y­ou would not un­­­der­­stand if I told you. So we’ll lea­­ve that out of the
ques­ti­o­n. He is im­­men­­se­­ly rich. His cheque for £300,000 would be
ho­nou­red by his bank at any mi­­nu­te. Ob­vious­­ly he is a pow­er. He has ha­d
re­a­­son to know that I am pit­ting my wits against his, and he flat­ter­s
him­­self that so far he has got the bet­ter of me. That is be­­cau­­se I am
dra­wing him on. I am ma­tu­ring a plan which will ma­ke him a poor and a
­­ve­ry mi­­se­ra­­ble man at one and the sa­­me time. If that sche­­me suc­­ceeds,
and I am sa­tis­­fied with the way you three men ha­­ve per­­for­­med the parts I
s­hall call on you to play in it, I shall pay to each of you the sum of
£10,000. If it does­n’t suc­­cee­d, then you will each re­­cei­­ve a thou­san­d
and your ex­­pen­­ses. Do you fol­low ­­me?”</p> 
 <p>It was evi­dent from their faces that they hung upon his eve­r­y word.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>But, re­­mem­­ber, I de­­mand from you your who­le and en­ti­­re la­­bour. Whi­le
y­ou are ser­ving me you are mi­­ne bo­dy and soul. I know you are
tru­st­wor­­thy. I ha­­ve had good proof that you are—pa­r­­don the
­ex­­pres­­sion—un­s­­cru­­pu­lous, and I flat­ter my­­self you are si­lent. What is
­­mo­re, I shall tell you nothing beyond what is ne­­ces­sa­ry for the ca­r­ry­ing
out of my sche­­me, so that you could not be­tray me if you would. Now for
­­my ­­plans!”</p> 
 <p>He sat down again and took a pa­per from his po­cket. Ha­ving pe­ru­sed it,
he tur­ned to Eas­to­ver.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>You will lea­­ve at on­­ce—that is to say, by the boat on We­d­­nes­day—­­for
­­Sy­d­­ney. You will book your pas­sa­­ge to­­-­­­mor­row mor­­ning, first thing, an­d
­­join her in Ply­­mouth. You will meet me to­­-­­­mor­row eve­­ning at an ad­dress I
will send you, and re­­cei­­ve your fi­nal in­­struc­ti­­ons­. ­­Goo­d­­-­­­night.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing that he was ex­pec­ted to go, Eas­to­ver ro­se, shook hands, and left
­the room wi­thout a word. He was too as­to­nis­hed to he­si­ta­te or to say a­ny­thing.</p> 
 <p>Ni­ko­la took an­o­ther let­ter from his po­cket and tur­ned to Pren­d­er­gast.
“<em>You</em>  will go down to Do­ver to­-­night, cross to Pa­ris to­-­mor­row mor­ning,
and lea­ve this let­ter per­so­nal­ly at the ad­dress you will find writ­ten on
it. On Thurs­day, at ha­l­f­-­past two pre­ci­se­ly, you will de­li­ver me an
ans­wer in the porch at Cha­ring Cross. You will find suf­fi­cient mo­ney in­
that en­ve­lo­pe to pay all your ex­pen­ses. Now ­go!”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>At ha­l­f­­-­­past two you shall ha­­ve your an­s­wer. ­­Goo­d­­-­­­night.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Goo­d­­-­­­night.”</p> 
 <p>When Pren­d­er­gast had left the room, Dr. Ni­ko­la lit an­o­ther ci­gar an­d
tur­ned his at­ten­ti­ons to Mr. ­Bax­ter.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Six months ago, Mr. Ba­x­ter, I found for you a si­tua­ti­on as tu­tor to the
y­oung Ma­r­­quis of Be­­cken­ham. You still hold it, I ­­sup­­po­­se?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ­­do.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Is the fa­ther well dis­­po­­sed to­wards y­ou?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>In eve­ry way. I ha­­ve do­­ne my best to in­­­gra­tia­te my­­self with him. That
­­was one of your ­in­struc­ti­­ons­.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Yes, yes! But I was not cer­tain that you would suc­­cee­d. If the old man
is any­thing li­ke what he was when I last met him he must still be a
­­dif­­fi­­cult per­­son to deal with. Does the boy li­ke y­ou?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ho­­pe ­­so.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ha­­ve you brought me his pho­to­­graph as I ­­di­rec­te­d?”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I ha­­ve. Here it is.”</p> 
 <p>Bax­ter took a pho­to­graph from his po­cket and han­ded it across the ta­ble.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Goo­d. You ha­­ve do­­ne ve­ry well, Mr. Ba­x­ter. I am ple­a­­sed with you.
To­­-­­­mor­row mor­­ning you will go back to York­s­hi­re——”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>I beg your pa­r­­don, Bour­­ne­­mouth. His Grace owns a hou­­se ne­a­r
­­Bour­­ne­­mouth, which he oc­­cu­pies du­ring the sum­­mer ­­months.”</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>Ve­ry well—then to­­-­­­mor­row mor­­ning you will go back to Bour­­ne­­mouth an­d
­­con­ti­­nue to in­­­gra­tia­te your­­self with fa­ther and son. You will al­­so be­­gin
to im­­plant in the boy’s mind a de­­si­re for tra­­vel. Don’t let him be­­co­­me
a­wa­­re that his de­­si­re has its sour­­ce in you—­­but do not fail to fos­ter
it all you can. I will com­mu­­ni­­ca­te with you fur­ther in a day or two. Now ­­go.”</p> 
 <p>Bax­ter in his turn left the room. The door clo­se­d. Dr. Ni­ko­la pi­cked up
­the pho­to­graph and stu­die­d it.</p> 
 <p><span class="dquo">“</span>The li­ken­ess is un­­­mi­­sta­­ka­ble—or it ought to be. My fri­en­d, my ve­r­y
­­de­ar fri­en­d, Wethe­rell, my toils are clo­­sing on you. My ar­ran­­ge­­ments are
­­per­­fec­ting them­­sel­­ves ad­­mi­ra­b­­ly. Pre­­sent­­ly, when all is com­ple­te, I
s­hall press the le­­ver, the ma­chi­­ne­ry will be set in mo­ti­o­n, and you will
­­find your­­self being slow­­ly but su­re­­ly ground in­­to pow­­der. Then you will
hand over what I want, and be sor­ry you thought fit to baulk Dr. ­­Ni­­ko­la!”</p> 
 <p>He rang the bell and or­de­red his bill. This du­ty dischar­ge­d, he pla­ce­d
­the cat back in its pri­son, shut the li­d, de­scen­ded with the bas­ket to
­the hall, and cal­led a han­som. The por­ter in­qui­red to what ad­dress he
s­hould or­der the cab­man to drive. Dr. Ni­ko­la did not re­p­ly for a mo­ment,
then he sai­d, as if he had be­en thin­king so­me­thing out: “The  <em>Green
­Sai­lor</em>  pu­blic­-­hou­se, East In­dia Dock Roa­d.”</p>
